# Pearson Python Institute highlights

## Overview
This folder contains a collection of simple python code that I wrote to complete various assignments during my enrollment in the "IT Specialist Python" and "Associate Python Programmer" courses offered by **Pearson Python Institute** and provided to me by **eCollege Ireland**.

## Card busters game
A simple two-player card game where each player's cards are compared round by round. Scores are tracked, and at the end, the overall winner is announced. 

## Down payment calculator
Calculates the best savings rate needed to afford a down payment on a dream home within three years. If it's determined that saving the down payment within 3 years is impossible, the function prints a corresponding message. Otherwise, it prints the best savings rate found and the number of steps taken in the bisection search.

## Load request calculator
Code that reads loan requests from a text file and processes them based on available funds ("kitty"). It performs two main operations: initially, it checks and prints the status of the loan requests, and then it writes the results to the same text file.

## Rock-paper-scissors game
Code that implements a simple rock-paper-scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The player's choice is taken as input, the computer's choice is randomly generated, and the game outcome is determined based on standard rules.

## Credits
- **Pearson Python Institute**: I learned the necessary skills to complete these assignments thanks to the helpful videos and exercises provided by Pearson Python Institute.
- **eCollege**: I was provided free access to these courses through the online learning platform, eCollege.
